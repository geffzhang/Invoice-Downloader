**Turn PDF, OFD, and XML e-invoices from your mailbox, plus supported invoice download links, into organized files and an Excel reimbursement summary.**

Designed for individuals, freelancers, and small teams that manually collect multiple e-invoices each month. Connect your own QQ Mail or 163 Mail account to collect invoices in batches, run OCR, archive them by category, and create a summary while retaining low-confidence results for human review.

Download: [latest Windows x64 installer and portable package](https://github.com/EthanYoQ/Invoice-Downloader/releases/latest)

*Email and invoice files are processed locally. If you enable GLM OCR / vision recognition, invoice images are sent to your configured model provider for extraction.*

## 🤖 Dual-Engine AI Extraction Architecture

The system employs **Track A + Track B + Local Fallback** as a three-layer defense. If any layer succeeds, its result is adopted, ensuring an extremely high recognition success rate.

![Dual-Engine AI Recognition Architecture](docs/track-ab.svg)

> **Why this design?**
> - **Track A** (OCR + LLM): Highest precision — extracts text structure first, then understands it
> - **Track B** (glm-4.5V Vision): Directly "looks at the image" — ideal for complex layouts or image-based invoices
> - **Local Fallback**: Local regex rules — works offline with zero API consumption

---

## 🔍 Four-Layer Smart Filtering Funnel

The system does not call AI for every email. Instead, it first passes through a four-layer funnel for precise filtering, significantly reducing false recognition rates and API costs.

![Four-Layer Smart Filtering Funnel](docs/funnel.svg)

After passing the filter, attachments also go through a **three-tier decision process**:

| Tier | Trigger Condition | Handling |
|------|-------------------|----------|
| 🗑️ **Tier A** (Discard) | Tracking pixels, logos, decorative images (≤32px) | Skipped directly |
| 📦 **Tier B** (Hold) | Attachments >5MB, ZIP unpack failure | Retained but not processed |
| ✅ **Tier C** (Archive) | Normal PDF/OFD/XML | Enters AI extraction pipeline |

---

## 🌐 Three-Tier PDF Recovery Strategy

Many invoice emails only contain "click to download" links. The system automatically identifies the platform and selects the optimal approach:

<details>
<summary>📖 Click to expand detailed steps for 163 mailbox</summary>

**Server Parameters**

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| IMAP Server | `imap.163.com` |

   - **Manual Method**: Manually send an SMS to the designated number as prompted
5. After sending the SMS, click **I Have Sent It**
6. The system generates a **16-character authorization code** (letter combination, **only displayed once — copy and save it immediately**)

> ⚠️ The authorization code is not your mailbox login password. It is a separate password specifically for third-party clients, and it is case-sensitive.

<summary>📖 Click to expand GLM API configuration steps</summary>

The system uses **GLM-4.5V** (multimodal vision) and **GLM-OCR** to recognize invoice content.

**Steps**

1. Visit [open.bigmodel.cn](https://open.bigmodel.cn/) and register an account
2. Go to Console → **API Keys** → **Create API Key**
3. Copy and save the Key (format: `xxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`)

**Cost Reference**

| Scenario | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 🎁 New User Bonus | 5 million GLM-4 tokens gifted (valid for 30 days) |
| 💰 Recommended Top-up | **Under 5 yuan**, pay-as-you-go |
| 📊 Usage Estimate | Each invoice consumes approximately 1,000–3,000 tokens; for 200 invoices/month, 5 yuan lasts about 12 months |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Windows x64 (installer / portable)

1. Installer: run `InvoiceFlowAI-*-windows-x64-setup.msi`. Portable: extract `InvoiceFlowAI-*-windows-x64-portable.zip` to a regular folder (avoid cloud-sync directories) and preserve the archive's directory structure.
2. Double-click `InvoiceFlowAI.exe`; the settings interface appears on first launch.
3. Enter your email address and authorization code (QQ or 163) and GLM API Key, then click "Start Scanning". Invoices are archived to the "Invoice Organizer" folder on your desktop.

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary>Q: White screen or no response after launching the software?</summary>

- Make sure the **entire archive is extracted**; the `_internal` folder must be in the same directory as `InvoiceFlowAI.exe`
- Avoid placing the software in a directory containing **Chinese characters or spaces**

</details>

<details>
<summary>Q: Very few invoices found after scanning?</summary>

- In the software's time range settings, **adjust the start date to more than 180 days ago**
- Some mailboxes default to fetching only the last 30 days of emails — select "Fetch all emails" in the mailbox IMAP settings

</details>

<details>
<summary>Q: Authentication failure after entering the authorization code?</summary>

- **QQ Mailbox**: Must be obtained through "Manage Service → Generate Authorization Code" — it is **not your QQ password**
- **163 Mailbox**: Must be generated from the "Enable IMAP Service" popup — it is **not your mailbox login password**, and it is case-sensitive
- The QQ authorization code must be regenerated after changing your QQ password

</details>

<details>
<summary>Q: GLM API reports insufficient balance?</summary>

Log in to [open.bigmodel.cn](https://open.bigmodel.cn/) → Billing Center → Top Up. Recommended top-up of **5 yuan**, pay-as-you-go.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Q: Some invoices end up in the Manual_Check folder?</summary>

This is normal. When AI recognition confidence is insufficient, the system automatically places invoices in the `Manual_Check` queue for manual confirmation. This is usually caused by blurry images, non-standard documents, or encrypted PDFs.

</details>

## 🛡️ Privacy & Security

- All emails and invoice files are processed **locally** and are never uploaded to any server
- Mailbox credentials are encrypted with **DPAPI** on Windows
- The GLM API only receives **invoice images** (Base64) for text recognition and does not send the original email content
